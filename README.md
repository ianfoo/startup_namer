My first [Flutter](https://flutter.io) project, as followed along in
[Flutter's](https://flutter.io/codelabs) [first
codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/).

## Notes

The most difficult/time consuming part of getting my first Flutter app going
was getting my environment set up. Nothing new there. But I had to install
Xcode, Android Studio, create an Android emulator, do some stuff in Xcode to
creating a signing profile or whatever it's called, install Cocoapods and a
handful of other Homebrew forumlas.

I have a Kindle Fire 7 that I was hoping to use as real Android hardware, but
adb wouldn't detect it even though I unlocked developer options and enabled
ADB. I was able to get the app running on an iPhone Simulator as well, and even
my actual iPhone, once the Xcode setup gynmastics had been completed, which
were only as difficult as they were because I'm not too familiar with Xcode.

To actually do the coding and manage the run of the Flutter app, I used [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the Flutter and Dart extensions. This
worked very well.
